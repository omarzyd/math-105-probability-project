# Math 105 Probability Project

## Overview
This project analyzes student performance using statistical and probabilistic methods. It includes comprehensive data cleaning, visualization, hypothesis testing, and multi-objective optimization through genetic algorithms. The goal is to predict academic success and identify significant factors influencing grades.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning:** Converted categorical variables to numeric and handled missing values.
- **Visualization:** Generated heatmaps, scatter plots, and distribution charts for insights.
- **Statistical Testing:** Performed hypothesis tests to analyze the influence of gender and parental education on grades.
- **Probability Analysis:** Calculated covariance, correlation, and binomial distributions for performance analysis.
- **Machine Learning:** Built multi-objective optimization models using genetic algorithms to balance academic success and extracurricular engagement.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy, Scikit-learn, DEAP
- **Tools:** Google Colab, Jupyter Notebooks
